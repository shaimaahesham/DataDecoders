# UK Train Rides Data Analysis

## Project Overview

![Demo](./dashboard.png)

This project focuses on analyzing UK train rides using raw railway data. The analysis includes statistical insights, a structured data model, visualizations, and a dashboard to better understand train ride patterns in the UK.

## Repository Structure

- **railway.csv** - The raw dataset containing UK train ride data.
- **railway_data_dictionary.csv** - A description of the dataset, including explanations of columns and data types.
- **RailWay_Tables.py** - A Python script that processes the raw dataset and divides it into sub-tables for structured analysis.
- **UK_Train_Rides (round1_analysis).xlsx** - The complete analysis file, including:
  - Statistical analysis
  - Data model & star schema
  - Visualizations
  - Interactive dashboard

## Project Workflow
1. **Data Exploration**: Understanding the dataset using the data dictionary.
2. **Data Processing**: Using `RailWay_Tables.py` to structure the data into sub-tables.
3. **Data Analysis**:
   - Performing statistical analysis on train rides.
   - Building a data model using a star schema for efficient querying.
4. **Visualization & Dashboard**:
   - Creating visualizations to identify trends and patterns.
   - Designing a dashboard for interactive insights.

## How to Use
1. Load `railway.csv` for raw data.
2. Use `RailWay_Tables.py` to process and organize the data.
3. Open `UK_Train_Rides (round1_analysis).xlsx` to explore the results and insights.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Pandas, NumPy (for data processing)
- Excel-compatible software (for viewing the analysis file)

### **UK Train Rides Analysis Project**  

#### **1. Project Planning & Management**  

- **Project Proposal**  
  - Analyzed UK railway travel data to identify trends in ticket sales, travel patterns, delays, and pricing.  
  - Created visualizations and dashboards for insights into train travel efficiency.  
  - Examined reasons for delays and factors affecting ticket prices.  

- **Project Plan**  
  - Defined a structured timeline, including data collection, cleaning, analysis, and visualization.  
  - Created dashboards summarizing key insights.  
  - Used Excel for data handling and visualizations.  

- **Task Assignment & Roles**  
  - Data collection and cleaning: Ensured dataset quality.  
  - Data analysis: Identified patterns in ticket sales, delays, and costs.  
  - Visualization: Created graphs and dashboards for better understanding.  

- **Risk Assessment & Mitigation Plan**  
  - **Data inconsistency** → Addressed missing or incorrect values.  
  - **Complexity in delay reasons** → Categorized reasons for better analysis.  
  - **Visualization clarity** → Designed intuitive and informative dashboards.  

- **KPIs (Key Performance Indicators)**  
  - Average train delay times.  
  - Most sold ticket types and classes.  
  - Most frequently visited cities.  
  - Total revenue and cost breakdown.
